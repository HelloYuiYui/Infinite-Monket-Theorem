# Infinite-Monkey-Theorem

Infinite monkey theorem states that if a monkey sits in front of a typewriter and hits random keys on the typewriter forever, there will eventually be logical and
meaningfull words, sentences, even Shakespear plays. I used the idea and replaced the monkey with a python code.

The program adds random letters to a string and stops if the input word is found in the string.

Inspired by the video below. (video in German)
