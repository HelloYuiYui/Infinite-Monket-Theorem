# Infinite-Monkey-Theorem
# Infinite monkey theorem is regenerated by python.

Infinite monkey theorem says that if a monkey sits in front of a computer and pushes random letters forever, there will be logical and
meaningfull sentences, even some Sheakespears plays. I took the same idea and replaced the monkey with a python code.

The program basically adds random letters to a string and stops if the demanded string is found within the long random letters.
